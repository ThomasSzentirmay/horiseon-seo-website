# Project Title

Horiseon SEO Webpage

# Project Description

I was given the starter code for a SEO and marketing website, and I needed to change the div tags to the appropriate semantic elements. Alt attributes were also added to the images and icons, along with a descriptive and fitting title being added to the head. Since I changed the HTML elements and tags, I also had to re-adjust some CSS code so that the website was still styled appropriately. Comments have been added in the CSS where this has occured.

A challenge faced was the first link in the nav bar not working. To fix this bug, I added an ID to the respective section.
